Supported protocols and amount of data collected vary by model and type of the communication module being interrogated. For example, the L8-series CPUs built-in Ethernet interface doesn't have a HTTP interface PEAT can retrieve data from. Why TRL 6? The module was tested against a significant number of PLCs with real logic in a high-fidelity emulation in Summer 2021, which meets the requirement of testing a prototype or representative of a deliverable in an actual environment or in a high-fidelity laboratory environment that emulates the actual environment.
