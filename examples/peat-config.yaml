# Configuration file for PEAT (the Process Extraction and Analysis Tool)
#
# PEAT uses PyYAML (https://pyyaml.org/) for YAML parsing, so anything
# that works for PyYAML will work here. YAML version 1.2 is used.

# --- General configuration options ---

# File paths to external/third-party PEAT device modules to import.
# These can be the path to a .py file with a DeviceModule subclass or a
# path to a folder with an __init__.py file and any number of .py
# files containing DeviceModule subclasses to import.
additional_modules: []

# DEBUG level (higher = more output, 0 = disabled)
debug: 0

# Prefix used for PEAT environment variables
env_prefix: "PEAT_CONFIG_"

# Hash algorithms to use wherever hashes are calculated.

# Available algorithms are any of the algorithms provided
# by Python's built-in "hashlib" library.

# --- Options for configuring PEAT's Command Line Interface (CLI) output ---

# Include DEBUG-level messages in the terminal output
verbose: false

# Don't write log messages to the terminal
quiet: false

# DEPRECATED. Setting this no longer has any effect, as it's now the default behavior.

# Don't color log messages in the terminal
no_color: false

# Don't print the PEAT logo at startup
no_logo: false

# "Dry run" when running on the CLI, do everything except running commands or
# connecting to servers. Actions won't be executed, but logs and state will
# still be written to files and saved to Elasticsearch (if enabled).
# This includes loading and verifying configuration and importing modules.

# Useful for verifying a YAML config file or other settings are correct,
# or that a third-party PEAT module is imported correctly.

# Default port used for basic TCP SYN online checks
# The default HTTP (web) port 80 is generally safe to check

# all hosts are online and valid devices. NOTE: requires a single
# device type to be specified.

# --- Options for configuring where PEAT saves files ---
# Note: "!JOIN" is a custom YAML construct to join variables
# and static strings into a single value.

# Default directory for all file output
# Note: changing this option will change the base directory for all other
# "*_dir" options, unless they're set to a non-default value.
out_dir: &OUTDIR "./peat_results/"

# Output directory for all files associated with a single run of PEAT.
#
# The name of this directory is automatically generated.
# This can be overridden by manual configuration,
# just be aware of the consequences when doing so.
#
# Name format: <command>_<config-name>_<timestamp>_<run-id>
# - <command> : PEAT command, e.g. "scan", "pull", "parse", etc.
# - <config-name> : name of YAML config file, set in metadata: name: "name".
#     If no config name is specified, then the string default-config is used.
# - <timestamp> : start time of the PEAT run, e.g. 2022-06-15_13-08-59.
#     This value is retrieved from consts.START_TIME.
# - <run-id> : Run ID, aka agent.id, e.g. 165532013980.
#     This value is retrieved from consts.RUN_ID.
